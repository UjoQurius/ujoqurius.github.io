## About me

Hello and welcome to my blog. In the digital world I go by handle *@qurius* and to briefly introduce myself I must say that I am just curious about how things work and love to dig deep when I don't understand. I am studying master's program on *Information Security* and have been dealing with security and hacking for about 4 years. I am [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/) and [CRTP](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/adlab) certified and while I am studying I work as a freelance penetration tester and do some research work at the university.

I decided that starting this blog will help me to stay consistent with studying and exploring new topics in penetration testing and security in general. I also read other people's blogs like [0xdf's](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/) and see how different people have different approaches and thought processes. This way I can acknowledge other people's methodologies and think more outside of the box while solving CTFs or performing a penetration test for a client. Therefore, if someone somehow stumbles across this blog and finds some approach that I took interesting and learns something from it, there is nothing more I could ask for.

## What can you find here

For now, this blog will consist of writeups for retired [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.com/) machines and writeups of [Vulnlab](https://www.vulnlab.com/) standalone machines, Active Directory chains and Red Team Labs. You can find these writeups [here](writeups/).
