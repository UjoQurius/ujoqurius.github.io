# A foreword to this blog
Dear readers (probably only me), I guess it would be rude to start off this blog without introducing myself at least a bit. I am studying master's program on *Information Security* and have been dealing with security and hacking for 3 years. I am also [OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) certified and have developed passion for binary exploitation, malware development and antivirus evasion.

That is why we are here. I promised myself that it will not be just deeply technical, nerdy stuff. But that I would share my knowledge of cyber threats on the internet and demonstrate how you, dear readers, can protect yourself and not "get hacked". However, you will find pretty nerdy stuff here, like a lot. Since it was not so easy to start, let me explain why have I decided not to do it and then why I decided to do it.

<br>

## Why did I struggle to begin
After almost a year of thinking about writing this blog I have caught myself in a vicious cycle of pushing it away for a pretty stupid, in fact a couple of stupid reasons. Let's take a look at them.

<br>

**1\. Self-doubt**

In a way I consider myself a perfectionist, very seldomly satisfied by the output of my work, no matter how daunting or painful it was to accomplish. This creates a bit of a psychological barrier for me and have always kept me wondering whether the content I would post here would be interesting and engaging enough for the people who might stumble upon it. Quality of the content was a big concern for me as well and I simply did not feel ready.

Nevertheless, I changed my mind after hearing now one of my favorite quotes: "*Take one step into the right direction and you are halfway there to make your dreams come true.*". I admit it sounds a bit cheesy and writing a blog is surely not a lifelong dream of mine. However, it made me realize the importance of the first step towards any goal in life. That is why you are now reading this page. The concerns and *self-doubt* were suppressed by this quote as well. I simply realized that without writing this blog I would never feel ready to write this blog and would keep pushing it away for long enough that I would *never* do it.

<br> 

**2\. Missing time frame**

Another reason to push this blog off was that I am a pretty busy person. Usually, I have my day "booked" for almost every hour combining university, work, hacking, programing, sports and life itself. Adding this blog to this whirlpool of time consuming madness seemed impossible. Then, another realization enlightened me. I realized that almost no one will be reading this blog, meaning I have zero pressure on publishing blogposts within a given time frame. It is up to me when I will post something. In fact I intend to use this blog as means to slow down, recollect my thoughts, deepen my knowledge and relax.

<br>

## Why am I doing it
After 3 years of hacking I have acquired quite bit of knowledge and **notes** which just sit on my computer. These notes contain various interesting exploitation techniques, tools and though processes. I have decided that it might be worth to gather and use these information to create content for people not having a technical background (since the cyber crime is on the rise and having a basic understanding of cyber threats will be necessary), beginners or even people with advanced knowledge in cyber security.

I am also doing it for myself: To keep my memory fresh, to deepen my knowledge and to push myself to explore more interesting topics in hacking and learn as much as possible.

<br>

## What can you find here
We have some formalities and touching story of me starting this blog behind us, let's discuss what you will find here. Serious stuff coming. Since I am interested in so many things I had to narrow the areas of interest to these 3 categories (for now):

1. [[frostvandrer.github.io/MalwareDevelopment/index|Malware development]]
2. [[frostvandrer.github.io/HTB/index|HackTheBox machines' writeups]]
3. [[frostvandrer.github.io/protect-yourself-online/index|Phishing awareness and how you can protect yourself online]]

If you made it this far, congratulations! There is a high probability that you are the only one who did so. Do not be surprised when you click on these links and find that there is nothing in there. As I mentioned above this is the *first step* towards building this blog and first blogposts on aforementioned areas of interest will be coming out in a near future.
