## [Vulnlab: Forgotten](../vulnlab/machines/forgotten/)

[Forgotten](../vulnlab/machines/forgotten/) is a easy (junior) level machine on [Vulnlab](https://www.vulnlab.com/) involving exploitation of a forgotten web installer of `LimeSurvey` survey application. After successful installation, the `LimeSurvey` allowed us to upload a malicious PHP plugin and we were able to get Remote Code Execution landing in docker instance. The box ends with a very nice way of leveraging root access to a docker instance and shared folder with the host for privilege escalation.

First part contains the web exploitation part of the machine and phishing to get the user and the second part will contain binary exploitation for privilege escalation.
