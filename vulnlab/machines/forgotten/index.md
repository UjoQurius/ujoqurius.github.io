# Vulnlab: Forgotten

Forgotten is a easy (junior) level machine on [Vulnlab](https://www.vulnlab.com/) involving exploitation of a forgotten web installer of `LimeSurvey` survey application. The installation allowed to supply a remote MySQL server instance and we could configure the web application to use our server as it's database. After successful installation, the `LimeSurvey` allowed us to upload a malicious PHP plugin and we were able to get Remote Code Execution landing in docker instance. This may seem like a bit far fetched scenario, however, as the machine's creator ([xct](https://twitter.com/xct_de)) pointed out, this is something that he encountered on a real life pentest. The box ends with a very nice way of leveraging root access to a docker instance and shared folder with the host.

I hope you enjoy this write up, let's get into it!

## Nmap

As with every machine, let's start with an Nmap scan. I use my own Rust wrapper which you can findÂ [here](https://github.com/qur1us/rustmap). Let's look at the results.
